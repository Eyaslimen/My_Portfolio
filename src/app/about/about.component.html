        <h1>A little bit about me</h1>
        <p class="about_me"> I'm a third-year software engineering student fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems. I’m diving deeper into web development and AI, constantly experimenting and learning through hands-on projects. I believe in progress over perfection—every mistake is a step forward. While I may not have all the answers yet, I’m excited about every opportunity to improve, grow, and bring ideas to life!</p>
